This the code that accompanies the [Switching Eds blog post](http://matthewearl.github.io/2015/07/28/switching-eds-with-python/).

The original script from the post is run like so:

    ./faceswap.py <head image> <face image>

If successful, a file `output.jpg` will be produced with the facial features
from `<head image>` replaced with the facial features from `<face image>`.

This is a fork of [this](https://github.com/matthewearl/faceswap) repository.  

My code amendments can be found in the file `try again.ipynb`.
